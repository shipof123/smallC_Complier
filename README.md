# Simple Small C Compiler

## Introduction

A simplified compiler frontend, including a **lexical analyzer** and a **syntax analyzer**, for `Small-C`, which is a C-like language containing a subset of the C programming language. Besides, it also implements a **code generator** to translate the intermediate representation, which is produced by syntax analyzer, into `LLVM` instructions.


Using **Flex**, **Bison** and **LLVM**

## Structure

- /tests			folder test cases 
- /testout		folder test cases output
- test.sh			test all cases with shell command " bash test.sh"
- includes.h 		common head file for all others
- Makefile 		makefile
- node.h 			definition for tree node and types of tree node 
- README.md 		list all files contained
- smallC.l 		lex file 
- smallC.y   		yacc file 
- llvm.h			part for generate LLVM IR code
- ast.h			for print the AST tree in project 1
- semantic.h		semantic analysis
- report.pdf		final report

## Usage

### 1.Quick test with testcase using scripts

```
./test.sh
```
Detail of the shell script is:
```
rm testcase-output/*;
make clean;
make;
./scc tests/arth.sc  			  testout/arth.ll
./scc tests/fib.sc  			  testout/fib.ll
./scc tests/gcd.sc                 	  testout/gcd.ll
./scc tests/io.sc          		  testout/io.ll
./scc tests/if.sc                         testout/if.ll
./scc tests/queen.sc             	  testout/queen.ll
./scc tests/struct.sc           	  testout/struct.ll
make clean;
```

All the testcase output will be saved at `testcase-output`.
Then you're free to use llvm runtime to excute IR codes. For example:
```
$ lli arth.ll
```

### 2.Run test manually

```
$ make
```

#### 1. Input from command line and output on command line
```
$ ./scc
```
> You are required to input your code. And the output of IR code will be will be print in command line and saved in file `NVM_RC_VERSION=`

#### 2. Input from file and output on command line
```
$ ./scc   inputPath
```
> Output of IR code will be print in command line and saved in file `NVM_RC_VERSION=`

#### 3. Input from file and output to file

```
$ ./scc   inputPath   outputPath
```

### Highlights

#### 1. Syntax Error Handling
If there is a syntax error, the compiler will return which line and what input causes the error.
For example:
```
Input:
int main(
}

Output
Error: syntax error at line 2
Parser does not expect }
```
#### 2. Semantic Error Handling
I have done some of the semantic error detection.
##### **Operand type checking**
As operation like `dot` or `[]`, we will first checking whether the operation is valid for the object. For example,:

```
Input:

int main()
{
	int x;
	x.get = 5;
	return 0;
}

---
Output:
....
Parsing Complete!
Error: Semantic error at line 4
Expected rules: EXPS: ID DOT ID
only struct can  be used as first parameter of Dot
Exit
```

##### **Declaration checking**
It maintain a symbol table the know whether the symbol has been declared. For example:

```
Input:

int main()
{
	return p;
}

---
Output:
....
Parsing Complete!
Error: Semantic error at line 3
Expected rules: EXPS: ID ARRS
not found symbol:p
Exit
```
##### **Resevered word  handling**
This is implemented by the flex and yacc, as there are reserved words ,It will generate error during the building of the tree.

##### **Break and continue checking**   
Break and continue can only be used in a for-loop. A stack is used to maintain if program is inside a for loop, and each time there meets the token will first check the stack.  For example:

```
Input:

int main()
{
	break;
	return 0;
}

---
Output:
....
Parsing Complete!
Error: Semantic error at line 3
Expected rules: STMT: BREAK ;
break must be in for statement
Exit
```

#### 3. Code Optimization
As there maintain a symbol table, for **unused function declaration**, the internal Tree Node will be directly removed for dead code elimination. As the same, **unused struct declaration** are also eliminated by removing the Node.

#### 4. Tree Structure Printing
As mentioned in project 1, I don't use pre-order to print the parse tree. Instead, I use complicated functions to print a more distinct and clear tree structures for sake of beauty and more intuitive sense of the parse tree.


**ATTENSION!!**  As I print the parse tree in lines for beauty, like this:

```
                  PROGRAM                  
                     |
                     |
                  EXTDEFS                  
                     |
                 |-------------------|
              EXTDEF              EXTDEFS
                 |                   |
  |---------|-------------|          
SPEC      FUNC        STMTBLOCK      ϵ
  |         |             |
  |    |-|---|---| |---|----|---|
TYPE  ID ( PARAS ) { DEFS STMTS }
  |    |     |         |    |
  |    |     |         |    |
 int main    ϵ         ϵ    ϵ

```

 Thus, the output parse is **very wide** when the input code is complex.

 You may need `MonoDevelop` under Ubuntu or some other text editors to open the output, otherwise some text editors like `sublime text3` will automatically create a new line for wide output which may affect the beauty. Or
you can just input fewer codes to see the output.
#### 5. Timer
The compiler will get the total time for the procedure. You can analysis the efficiency with the clock time.

```
...
-------------------
InputFile -> testcase-input/queen/queen.sc
Parsing Complete!
Translation Complete!
Total time spent: 2.74ms

-------------------
InputFile -> testcase-input/struct/struct.sc
Parsing Complete!
Translation Complete!
Total time spent: 1.11ms
...
```

## A Little More Details

![compiler-project-img-1](http://7xpne1.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/compiler-project-img-1.jpg)

### Lexical Analyzer

A lexical analyser has been implemented in this part. It reads the source codes of **SMALLC** and separates them into tokens. The work is done using *FLEX* and the related file is `"lex.l"`

#### Read and Write

Since most of the details of **TOKENS** and **Operators** are given to us in the project requirement, I will not talk about them in the report. Instead, I will show you how to deal with **read** and **write** tokens. They are also very simple:

```
read 			{ yylval.string = strdup(yytext); return (READ);}
write 		    { yylval.string = strdup(yytext); return (WRITE);}
```

### Syntax Analyzer

In this step, I performed the syntax analysis using *YACC* and the file name is `"parser.y"`.

#### Precedence of *IF* and *IF ELSE* Statement

There exists a conflict in the implementation of "*IF LP EXP RP STMT*" and "*IF LP EXP RP STMT ELSE STMT*", and the former one should have a lower precedence than the latter one. Here is the implementation:

	%nonassoc LOWER_THAN_ELSE
	%nonassoc ELSE
	%%
	STMT:
	 | IF LP EXP RP STMT %prec LOWER_THAN_ELSE
	 | IF LP EXP RP STMT ELSE STMT
	 ;

#### Error Message
The error message is done together with generating the parse tree. Once an error occurs during the procedure, the parse process will shutdown and report the just-found mistake:

```
int yyerror(const char *msg)
{
	fflush(stdout);
	fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s at line %d\n", msg,yylineno);
	fprintf(stderr, "Parser does not expect '%s\n'",yytext);
}
```

It will show you the line number of the error and its error text.

### Semantic Analyzer & IR Generation

In this section, I have implemented the Semantic Analyzer & IR Generation together with the formation of the parse tree.

#### Tree Generation

The Parse Tree Generation is based on the construction of different kinds of Node and implements its `codegen` function. For example, some of the different variables of *Node* and there usage are shown in the table below:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><B>Contained By</B></td>
		<td><B>Variable Name</B></td>
		<td><B>Usage</B></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><B>All</B></td>
		<td>int mi_LineNum</td>
		<td>Line Number, used by error message</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>NodeType</td>
		<td>Type of the node, e.g. Expression, Statement, Declaration</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>Name</td>
		<td>Different uses in different variables, e.g. function name</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><B>Expression</B></td>
		<td>ExpressionType</td>
		<td>The type of expression, e.g. binary_operator</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>bool ValueExpression</td>
		<td>Whether it is an L-Value Expression</td>
	</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>...</td>
		<td>...</td>
		<td>...</td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Register Allocation

According some reference book, the algorithm is shown below, a little bit like **FIFO**:
1. Maintain a set `freeRgSet`for free registers .
2. whenever `regFree` is called, then the specific register will be add to  `freeRgSet`
3. whenever `regAllocate` is called, then return the first element of `freeRgSet`. If there are no valid reg then return a newly created name.

#### Intermediate Representation

These are all related to llvm documents. And implements through code-gen functions in all inherits of Node class.
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><B>Small C</B></td>
		<td><B>LLVM IR</B></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<tr>
		<td>read</td>
		<td>%s = call i32 (i8*, ...)* @__isoc99_scanf(i8*
getelementptr inbounds ([3 x i8]* @.str, i32 0, i32
0), i32* %s) </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>write</td>
		<td>%s = call i32 (i8*, ...)* @__isoc99_scanf(i8*
getelementptr inbounds ([3 x i8]* @.str, i32 0, i32
0), i32* %s) </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>continue, break</td>
		<td>br label %%%s </td>
	</tr>	 
	<tr>
		<td>return </td>
		<td>ret i32 %s </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>.... </td>
		<td>.... </td>
	</tr>
</table>
